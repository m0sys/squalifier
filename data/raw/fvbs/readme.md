# Front VS Back Squat dataset

This datset contains about 800 images of single humans performing either a front squat or a back squat. The images were gathered using Google Images. They were then cleaned using fastai's ImageCleaner class and the images were further preprocessed using GIMP. The preprocessing done with GIMP was the seperation of muti humans performing the exercise by croping each into their seperate image.

The work was done by the author of this repository (mhd53).

In order to provide faster download the files are uploaded to s3 bucket.
